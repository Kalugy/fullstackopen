#CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content.

#Anatomy of a CSS ruleset

Selector
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.

Declaration
This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

Properties
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.


Different types of selectors

Element selector p
ID selector #my-id
Class selector .my-class
Attribute selector img[src]
Pseudo-class selector a:hover
